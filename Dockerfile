# This is the final, correct recipe for the deployment server.

# 1. Start with a pre-built environment that has Java 8 and Maven
FROM maven:3.8.5-openjdk-8

# 2. Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy all of your project files
COPY . .

# 4. Run the Maven build command and skip the tests
RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests

# 5. This is the final, correct command to start your application.
# It directly provides the NEW database credentials, bypassing all other configuration.
# The "-Dserver.port=${PORT}" line is a special instruction for Render to use the correct network port.
